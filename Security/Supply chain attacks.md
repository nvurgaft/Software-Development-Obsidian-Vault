A _software supply chain_ consists of all the software and tools used to create and maintain a software product. This includes not only the software developed for the product itself but all the software and tools used in its production.

In a supply chain attack, the attacker targets part of the product's supply chain in order to compromise the product itself.

The most obvious example here is a third-party library. If you use, for example, an [[NPM (Node Package Manager)|npm]] package developed by a third party, it has the ability to compromise your site. It may do so deliberately, if it is malicious, or accidentally, if it contains inadvertent vulnerabilities of its own. Essentially, you have to trust your third-party dependencies as much as you trust your own code.

Less obviously, the same principle applies to all the tools you use in creating your software, including code editors, editor plugins, version control systems, build tools, and so on. Any of these tools could insert malicious or vulnerable code into your final software product, in the course of the transformations they apply.
